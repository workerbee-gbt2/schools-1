# Medical Eligibility Form Details

## Overview
Details about the specific forms required for the Preparticipation Physical Evaluation (PPE) in California.

## History and Purpose of the PPE

### Purpose
The primary goal of the Preparticipation Physical Evaluation (PPE) is to promote the health and safety of athletes [3](#ref-3). Key objectives include:
- **Safety and Screening**: Identifying life-threatening conditions (such as cardiovascular risks) or injury predispositions that could make participation unsafe [3](#ref-3).
- **Health Evaluation**: Assessing physical and psychological health, including mental health screenings [3](#ref-3).
- **Medical Home Integration**: Ideally conducted by a primary care provider to ensure continuity of care and comprehensive medical history [4](#ref-4).
- **Counseling and Education**: Providing health and lifestyle counseling and connecting athletes with regular medical care [3](#ref-3).
- **Standardization**: Maintaining a consistent, evidence-based approach for middle school through college athletes [5](#ref-5).

### History
The PPE has evolved over decades from localized practices into a standardized national monograph [3](#ref-3):
- **1976**: The American Medical Association's (AMA) Committee on Medical Aspects of Sports first recognized the importance of the PPE [6](#ref-6).
- **1992**: Publication of the first official PPE Monograph establishing a unified standard [7](#ref-7).
- **2010**: Release of the 4th edition reflecting updated medical evidence [8](#ref-8).
- **2019**: Publication of the 5th (current) edition, which introduced chapters on mental health, transgender athletes, and disability screening [3](#ref-3).

The PPE is developed collaboratively by major medical organizations, including the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM), American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM), and American Osteopathic Academy of Sports Medicine (AOASM) [4](#ref-4).

## Medical Eligibility Form Components
The Medical Eligibility Form is used to communicate an athlete's clearance status for sports participation while maintaining privacy regarding their medical history [2](#ref-2). It consists of the following sections:

### Student Identification
Includes the student's full name and date of birth [2](#ref-2).

### Eligibility Status
The licensed healthcare provider selects one of five eligibility categories for the student [2](#ref-2):
- Medically eligible for all sports without restriction [2](#ref-2).
- Medically eligible for all sports without restriction with recommendations for further evaluation or treatment [2](#ref-2).
- Medically eligible for certain sports [2](#ref-2).
- Not medically eligible pending further evaluation [2](#ref-2).
- Not medically eligible for any sports [2](#ref-2).

### Recommendations and Provider Statement
The form includes space for specific medical recommendations and a formal statement from the healthcare provider [2](#ref-2). The provider (MD, DO, NP, or PA) must sign and provide their contact information, confirming they have examined the student and found no clinical contraindications to participation [2](#ref-2).

### Shared Emergency Information
To ensure student safety, this section is intended to be shared with coaches and school officials. It contains [2](#ref-2):
- Known allergies [2](#ref-2)
- Current medications [2](#ref-2)
- Other relevant medical information [2](#ref-2)
- Emergency contact details [2](#ref-2)

## Preparticipation Physical Evaluation (PPE) FAQs

**How often is a PPE required?**
While California (CIF) requires a physical evaluation annually (see [CIF Medical Eligibility Requirements](cif_requirements.md)) [11](#ref-11), there is no universal frequency nationally [9](#ref-9). Some states require an evaluation every 18 months or once upon entry into high school [9](#ref-9). The NFHS SMAC suggests that while a comprehensive exam may occur every 2-3 years, annual screenings for specific areas like heart, head, heat, mental health, and musculoskeletal issues are beneficial [9](#ref-9), [10](#ref-10).

**When should the PPE be scheduled?**
Ideally, the PPE should be conducted at least six weeks before the start of the sports season to allow time for any necessary follow-up evaluations or treatments [9](#ref-9).

**Are PPEs from other states accepted for transfer students?**
The NFHS SMAC encourages schools to accept documented PPEs from out-of-state transfer students, noting that variations in forms across states do not significantly impact the effectiveness of the evaluation [10](#ref-10).

**What were the specific recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic?**
During the 2020-21 period, the NFHS SMAC recommended a one-year extension for existing PPEs that were set to expire, provided it aligned with state laws [10](#ref-10). However, new participants (such as incoming freshmen) were still required to obtain a new PPE before participating [10](#ref-10).
