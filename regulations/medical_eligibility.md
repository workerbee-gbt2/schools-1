# Medical Eligibility Form Details

## Overview
Details about the specific forms required for the Preparticipation Physical Evaluation (PPE) in California.

## History and Purpose of the PPE

### Purpose
The primary goal of the Preparticipation Physical Evaluation (PPE) is to promote the health and safety of athletes [2](#ref-2). Key objectives include:
- **Safety and Screening**: Identifying life-threatening conditions (such as cardiovascular risks) or injury predispositions that could make participation unsafe [2](#ref-2).
- **Health Evaluation**: Assessing physical and psychological health, including mental health screenings [2](#ref-2).
- **Medical Home Integration**: Ideally conducted by a primary care provider to ensure continuity of care and comprehensive medical history [3](#ref-3).
- **Counseling and Education**: Providing health and lifestyle counseling and connecting athletes with regular medical care [2](#ref-2).
- **Standardization**: Maintaining a consistent, evidence-based approach for middle school through college athletes [4](#ref-4).

### History
The PPE has evolved over decades from localized practices into a standardized national monograph [2](#ref-2):
- **1976**: The American Medical Association's (AMA) Committee on Medical Aspects of Sports first recognized the importance of the PPE [5](#ref-5).
- **1992**: Publication of the first official PPE Monograph establishing a unified standard [6](#ref-6).
- **2010**: Release of the 4th edition reflecting updated medical evidence [7](#ref-7).
- **2019**: Publication of the 5th (current) edition, which introduced chapters on mental health, transgender athletes, and disability screening [2](#ref-2).

The PPE is developed collaboratively by major medical organizations, including the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM), American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM), and American Osteopathic Academy of Sports Medicine (AOASM) [3](#ref-3).
