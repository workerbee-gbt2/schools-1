## Preparticipation Physical Evaluation (PPE) FAQs

**What is the purpose of the Preparticipation Physical Evaluation (PPE)?**
The primary goals of the PPE are to determine the general physical and psychological health of the athlete, evaluate for life-threatening or disabling conditions (such as cardiac issues), identify predispositions to injury or illness, and serve as an entry point into the healthcare system for adolescents [2](#ref-2), [3](#ref-3).

**Where should a PPE be performed?**
It is considered best practice for the PPE to be performed in the athlete's "medical home" (their primary care provider's office) rather than through mass school screenings or urgent care centers [2](#ref-2). This ensures a more thorough review of medical history and continuity of care [2](#ref-2).

**How often is a PPE required?**
While California (CIF) requires a physical evaluation annually (see [CIF Medical Eligibility Requirements](cif_requirements.md)) [4](#ref-4), there is no universal frequency nationally [2](#ref-2). Some states require an evaluation every 18 months or once upon entry into high school [2](#ref-2). The NFHS SMAC suggests that while a comprehensive exam may occur every 2-3 years, annual screenings for specific areas like heart, head, heat, mental health, and musculoskeletal issues are beneficial [2](#ref-2), [3](#ref-3).

**When should the PPE be scheduled?**
Ideally, the PPE should be conducted at least six weeks before the start of the sports season to allow time for any necessary follow-up evaluations or treatments [2](#ref-2).

**Are PPEs from other states accepted for transfer students?**
The NFHS SMAC encourages schools to accept documented PPEs from out-of-state transfer students, noting that variations in forms across states do not significantly impact the effectiveness of the evaluation [3](#ref-3).

**What were the specific recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic?**
During the 2020-21 period, the NFHS SMAC recommended a one-year extension for existing PPEs that were set to expire, provided it aligned with state laws [3](#ref-3). However, new participants (such as incoming freshmen) were still required to obtain a new PPE before participating [3](#ref-3).
