# CIF Medical Eligibility Requirements

## Overview
This document covers the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) requirements for student-athlete physicals, governed by the California Education Code and CIF Bylaws.

## CIF General Requirements
The CIF constitution (500 series) establishes several core requirements for student-athlete medical eligibility [5](#ref-5):

*   **Annual Requirement**: Students must receive an annual physical examination, defined as one completed within the last 365 days [5](#ref-5).
*   **Timing**: The examination must be completed before a student may try out, practice, or participate in interscholastic athletic competition [5](#ref-5).
*   **Medical Practitioner**: The examination must be conducted by a licensed health care provider certifying that the student is physically fit. While CIF bylaws reference Medical Doctors (MD) and Doctors of Osteopathy (DO), Nurse Practitioners (NP) and Physician Assistants (PA) may also provide written clearance if working under the direct supervision of an MD or DO [5](#ref-5). This is consistent with state education code which permits PAs to conduct these examinations [2](#ref-2).
*   **Approved Forms**: The report must be on a school board-approved form that includes a health history. CIF strongly recommends the [Pre-Participation Physical Evaluation form](medical_eligibility.md) endorsed by major medical societies [1](#ref-1), [5](#ref-5).
*   **Exemptions**: Students may be excused from the physical examination if there is compliance with Education Code provisions regarding a parent/guardian/caregiver's 'Refusal to Consent' [5](#ref-5).
