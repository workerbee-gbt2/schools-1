# Schools in Bay Area for School Physical Outreach

## Objective

Build an in depth knowledge base on schools in the Bay Area and their potential for outreach for free school physicals. This outreach will be done to offer free school physicals for under-resourced students who would otherwise not be able to get one. 
Requirements to add a school is that they are in the Bay Area within driving distance of Palo Alto (East Bay or South Bay)
Important details for each school:
Their status as a Title 1 school
Their ratings for opportunities and athletic resources
Student demographic by income
Number of students
Other relevant information

Each school should have a folder with a information.md file containing this information.
In addition each school folder should have a contacts.md with key contacts, particularly those involved in athletics such as the athletic director. 
Provide as much contact info as available for each contact, this is of high priority. Communicate this priority to the research agents in the tasks you create.
Add additional files and agents for schools as necessary

It is important that this is a comprehensive and in depth knowledge base, not a surface level overview, and care should be taken such that every possible angle is explored. Additionally, adding specific data whenever possible is preferred. A typical file should have at least 4 different research tasks. Make sure to do a thorough web search to find relevant information to create research tasks for. 

## Knowledgebase Structure

```
knowledgebase/
  schools/
    <school-name>/
      contacts.md
      information.md
  regulations/
```

The knowledgebase should have a maximum depth of about 3 (excluding the root knowledgebase folder), though individual folders may have different depths. There should be about 50 files total in the knowledgebase.

## Scope
- It is important that there is a mix of specific data / information and broad summaries.
- Be aggressive in the number of research tasks you create, and make sure to look at a wide range of sources.
- Be sure to always look at multiple perspectives on a topic, and make sure to include information about potential risks and opportunities.
